# 🗳️ Real-Time Election Vote Processing System

## 📌 Project Description

This project aims to design and implement a **scalable and efficient big data architecture** for real-time election vote processing. The system ingests votes from different parties and candidates while ensuring **data integrity and scalability**. Using **Kafka** as the backbone for streaming, **Spark** for processing, and **Elasticsearch** for analytics, the architecture enables real-time visualization and insights into voting trends. The system also integrates **PostgreSQL** for structured data storage and employs **Streamlit** and **Apache Superset** for an interactive dashboard.

## 🛠️ Big Data Architecture & Tools Used

### 1️⃣ Kafka (Streaming Ingestion) 🔗
- Streams **real-time voting data** from various sources.
- Ensures **fault-tolerant message delivery**.
- 📝 Example: Votes cast by different parties are published as events in Kafka topics.

### 2️⃣ Apache Spark (Processing Engine) ⚡
- Processes vote streams for **real-time aggregation and transformation**.
- Ensures **scalability and speed** with distributed computing.
- 📝 Example: Calculating vote counts dynamically.

### 3️⃣ PostgreSQL (Relational Database) 🗄️
- Stores **structured data** (candidates, parties, and voters).
- Ensures **data durability and integrity**.
- 📝 Example: Storing candidate profiles and voter metadata.

### 4️⃣ Elasticsearch (Search & Analytics Engine) 🔍
- Stores and indexes vote counts for **real-time querying**.
- Enables **fast search and analytics**.
- 📝 Example: Querying votes received by a candidate instantly.

### 5️⃣ Streamlit (Visualization Tool) 📊
- Provides an **interactive dashboard** for real-time vote monitoring.
- **Visualizes voting trends** in an intuitive format.
- 📝 Example: A dynamically updating **bar chart** for votes per party.

### 6️⃣ Apache Superset (Dashboarding) 📈
- Enables **data exploration and visualization**.
- Supports **SQL-based analytics** for deeper insights.
- 📝 Example: Creating a **real-time election results dashboard**.
